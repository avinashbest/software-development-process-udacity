## Importance of Software? Why do we need it?

> First, What is a computer? It's a programmable device. So the essence of computing is programming. So program development is basically the most essential use of the computer. So software engineering is the discipline that investigates program development. So, how can it been done more efficiently? What's the best way of doing program development? And how can you develop reliable programs? So that's how I would define it. But I consider any software development activity software engineering activity.

> Software engineering is the systematic application of method to build software in a rigorous way. And I think one of the aspects that I like to bring into the notion of software engineering is that is's something that involves not only kind of technically building the system but understanding the requirements, working with stake holders. Trying to find a solution that balances all of the stakeholders needs in order to deliver the software thats tested and its rigorous to meet the needs of a stakeholder.

> Well, software engineering is the whole process of creation of software using engineering principles.

> My view is kind of a holistic view and I think about it from the perspective of hwo is software engineering different from programming. So, I think that research about programming is all about the create part of software. And that software engineering is about the entire life cycle. So, that's one aspect. And the other aspect of the definition is it's about quality, the quality of software. Software engineering even considers things long after you ship which we all know is one of the, it is the largest economic piece of software development.

> So, improve software engineering process for better software productivity and quality.

> The set of activities that one engages in when building software systems or software products. It's fundamentally a venue-creating activity. It involves social processes.

> Software engineering is the act of many people working together and putting together many versions of large and complex systems. And our world depends on software, software complex and were is immensely complex and we need many, many smart people to build these things.

> Well, engineering I think is the activity of envisioning and realizing valuable new functions with sufficient and justifiable confidence that the resulting system will have all of the critical quality attributes that are necessary for the system to be a success. And software engineering is the activity of doing this not only for the software components of engineering systems but for the system overall, given that it's so heavily reliant on it's underlying software technologies.

> I would say software engineering is the kind of art and practice of building software systems.

> Software engineering, in a nutshell, is a set of methods and principles and techniques that we have developed to enable us to engineer, or build, large software systems that outstrip or outpace one engineer's or even a small team of engineers ability or abilities to understand and construct and maintain overtime. So it requires a lot of people, it requires a long, term investment by an organization or a number of organizations, and often times it requires support for systems that are intended for one purpose but end up getting used for many additional purposes in addition to the original one.

> Software engineering is about building and constructing very large-scale high-quality systems, so the high quality is the big issue.

> Software engineering is engineering discipline of developing software-based systems, usually embedded into larger systems composed of hardware and business processes. Well, software is pervasive in all industry sectors and therefore systems must be reliable, safe and secure. Why can't we just get that by sitting down and writing software? Well, you could if software was small and simple enough to be developed by one or two people together in room. But software development now is distributes, involves teams of people with different backgrounds who have to communicate with each other. It also involves customers, clients, users. Software engineers have to work with hardware engineers, with domain experts and therefore, well, no, we can't simply sit down and start coding.

> Software engineering is mostly being able to program. And you need to be able to put big systems together so that they actually work. And if you don't use software engineering practices, you're not going to be able to put them together? Well, you're not going to be able to reliably put them together. So basically, you could maybe hack something up, but it's not going to necessarily stand the test of time. If somebody wants to change it it's probably going to break.

> It's important because if you don't think about how you're building this system and how you're trading off different aspects, like performance and scalability and reliability, then it's going to end up breaking or not lasting very long or not, not doing everything that you want it to do, or being really expensive.

> If it's not done in a principled way it will be bad and every user will suffer. That's why we need software engineering.

> It is important, because I mean these two goal, productivity, faster, in developing software. And higher quality would be apparently important. Software is everywhere.

> It's important because we use software in everyday life. Everything's built on software systems. And these are ubiquitous across our society.

> It's important because software is everywhere around us and the way we build it, and the way we maintain it, is something that determines almost a basic quality of life nowadays. And getting that software right can make a difference, oftentimes, between a really fun product and one that you won't like to use a reasonably successful company, or one that fails. And in more extreme cases even the difference between life and death, if you think about the software that runs in the airplane on which many of you fly on a regular basis.

> There are programs out there that if they screw up we are all screwed.

> Software engineering is crucially important because it's the engineering discipline that is uniquely capable of carrying out the engineering mission for software reliant systems.
