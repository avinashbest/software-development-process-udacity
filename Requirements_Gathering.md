# Requirements Gathering

Requirements Gathering is the most difficult task that software engineers faces. In industry, we may gather requirements from end users, external clients, or from co-workers in other areas of your own company. Occasionally, you may receive a well documented set of requirements. However, in most cases, we will need to clean the requirements from conversations with the prospective clients, and distill them down into something actionable on your own.

**for e.g,** A teacher came to you with a request for a piece of software their students could use to find out the average length of the sentences in their essays.

**Q. Which question is more informative?**

    [❌] What OS should it run on ?
    [✅] How will the user specify input?
    [❌] How many lines of code should it take?

**Average Sentence Length**

- Vanilla `Java 1.6`.
- Compile with `javac`, no options.
- executable from command line.
- user specifies file path.
- user specifies delimiters with `-d`.
- user specifies word length limit with `-l`.
